{"license":"GPL-3.0","file_hash":null,"name":"Orchid","version":"0.0.1","description":"Orchid is a collection of practical nodes. The package is designed to support logic, technical, and mathematical solutions. In particular, many solutions are implemented as recursive functions, which means that solutions can solve nD-list challenges. In addition, the package also contains solutions that can be used working with Revit families. Furthermore, solutions for external applications included in the BIM wheel are supported, which not necessarily are Autodesk products. These solutions include e.g. solutions for estimation and load bearing challenges.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMore information: Contact @erfajo at https://forum.dynamobim.com, https://forum.dynamobim.com/u/erfajo","group":"Orchid","keywords":["orchid","erfajo","logic","technical","mathematical","recursive","element","list","family","type","instance"],"dependencies":[],"contents":"Install or Update Orchid - How to install or update the Orchid package? \r\nAdd a watch node to read the instruction, a web browser has opened the Github link for you.
